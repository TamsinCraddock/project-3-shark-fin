# Shark Fin

Shark Fin is a word challenge game. A simple game that is played in the command line. 

This game is a modern take on the traditional 'Hangman' version. 

The aim of the game is to guess a random word by entering one letter at a time. You have a limited number of attempts. If you manage to guess the correct word before you run out of attempts, you win, otherwise the shrk catches you and you lose.

The game concept is simple, but it is a challenging game. It's a great way to sit back, relax and challenge yourself. Enjoy!

### How Shark Fin works:
- The program chooses one word randomly from the list with 500 different words.
- The word is presented as dashes, one for each letter in the word.
- It is only allowed to guess one letter at a time. The Shark Fin dosn't move forward if it's a correct guess.
